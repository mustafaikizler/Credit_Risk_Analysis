# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
Selling a credit card for a bank is always profitable, however there is high risk involved in this fruitfull business as well. üçá
In this project we tried to determine how risky is the credit card sales by using machine learning. We used supervised learning techique. That means, we used data that contains customer's previous behaviours and status and tried to determine is there is low risk or high risk for baking industry.

One of the obstacles was the ratio of good loans towards risky loans. Because of the good loans number was very high, we had to use oversample and undersample techniques in order to balance the data risk volume.

And lastly we tried to predict the credit risk by using BalanceRandomFOrestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
## Results
### Interpretation of Balanced Accuracy Scores and the Precision and Recall Scores

#### Random Oversampling
